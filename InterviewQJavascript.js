first class object in javascript?
In computer science, a programming language is said to support first-class functions (or function literal) if it treats functions as 
first-class objects. Specifically, this means that the language supports constructing new functions during the execution of a program, 
storing them in data structures, passing them as arguments to other functions, and returning them as the values of other functions.
>A function is an instance of the Object type
>A function can have properties and has a link back to its constructor method
>You can store the function in a variable
>You can pass the function as a parameter to another function
>You can return the function from a function
