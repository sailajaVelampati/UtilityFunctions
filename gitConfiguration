protocals - ssh, http, git protocal
---------------------------------------
ssh- utilizes ssh authentications, 
does not require a git specific deamon, 
encrypts to and from gitthe server, 
requires authenticated user,
---------------------------------------
http - requires to set up wed server to serve git repositories,
encrypts to and from git the server,
enables encrypted anonymous user acces if desired.
provides inefficient data transfer
---------------------------------------
git - inefficient data transfer,
lackes authentication support
additional cofiguration over other protocols.
does not encrypt traffic btw client and server.
commonly used for public access to repositories.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

VCS - version control system


3 stages of file - committed, modified, staged.
commited - changes resides safely in the local database. 
modified - when a commited / tracked file is changed.
stages - modified file ready  for commit / newly added file yet to commit.

2types of files 
tracked - tracked file that are part of previous snapshot.
untracked - file that did not exist in the last commit snapshot.

3 states of a GIT project
working directory - Checkout a version of the project from origin
staging area(index) - stage fixes for next commit
.git directory (repository) - commit changes from index

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

git commands - 
git config --global user.name "sailaja velampati"
git config --global user.email "sailajasmart@gmail.com"

to change config options to a specfic project 
git config  user.name "sailaja velampati1"
git config  user.email "sailajasmart1@gmail.com"

git config --list - gives all config settings.

man git - cover every git command.
HIGHT-LEVEL COMMANDS (PORCELAIN) - list og all main commands

git help [subheading] - returns small list

git fetch - download objects and refs from anaother repository.
git pull - fetch from and integrate with another repository or local branch
git push / git push -u origin master - update remote refs along with associated objects.
git add . - add files to the stagging area and be tracked.
git commit -m "" - commits the file to the local database.
git remote add origin [link] - add locla repository to the remote repository.
git status - discribes the status of the files.
git status --short  - short message of staus dtat m- modified, A - added to the staging area, ?? - untacked by git
git stash - when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working 
directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.
git stash save "my_stash_name" - save stash with name.
git stash pop - adds changes back into the working directory.
git stash list - show list of stash along with branch and commit data.
git stash show - better detailed view of 
https://devconnected.com/how-to-git-stash-changes/
open -a [name of text editor] [filename] - open file in text editor.

git diff --staged - compares the chages of staged file to the previously commited snapshot.
git diff --staged --no-renames - compares the hash references.
git diff -  compares the unstaged files.

git commit -a -m "" - add all the staged and modified file in on statment.

git log -  give the list of commit is the reverse chronological order, being the latest fisrt,
git log -[number] - no of commits to be shown
git log --oneline -  short details of commit
git log --stat - detail version of each commits.

Good practice form commit message : 
Captalise subject line,
Do not end subject with the period,
limit the message to 72 characters,
----------------------------------------------------------

git rm [filename] - removes file from the directory
git rm --cached [filename] - unstages the files and storps tracting it , but will not remove it from the directory

git mv [filename] [new filename] - renames the file name and it is still tracked.

Branching
---------
git checkout -b [branch name] - creates a new branch
get merge master - merges master data into the new branch.
:wq - exit vem tool
HEAD - is the current state of branch we are on.

Rest 
.......

git reset --soft - moves specific commit or commits to staging area.
git reset / git reset --mixed - moves the changes back to the working directory
git reset --hard - moves the commit chages to the trash

Advanced Git 

Git Object Model:
Commits:conatins info of author, timestamp it is created, refference to the parent commit, 
Snapshots: Reprensets the state of file and directores at the time of commit. each directory is termed as tree, and files as blobs,
References:Each commit is reffernced with uniques SHA-1 hash
