When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.
A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page.
You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.
postMessage() - posts message back to the browser.
onmessage(event) - this is the vent listener event has data of web workers.
terminate() - will terminate the event listener.
if the webworker variavle is set to undefined it can be reused.
Since web workers are in external files, they do not have access to the following JavaScript objects:
>The window object
>The document object
>The parent object
