positioning elements
static:always positioned according to the normal flow of the page
relative: positioned relative to its normal position
fixed:it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the
element.
absolute:is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
sticky:is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
